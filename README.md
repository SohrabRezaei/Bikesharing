# Bikesharing_Challenge

## Overview of the analysis

Several visualizations have been requested from us to show whether this business proposal is acceptable or not. These visualizations consist of displaying the length of time all genders use these bikes, and counting the number of bike trips for all genders and type of users for each hour of every day in the week. Finally, two previous visualizations are added to our story to persuade the audience more vigorosly.
